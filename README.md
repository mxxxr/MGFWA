# Multi-Guiding Spark Fireworks Algorithm

### NEWS
âœ¨ We have released a GPU-accelerated version of MGFWA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03944), available in ```alg/GPU-MGFWA.py```. Please note that a custom neural network is required to fully utilize this optimization. 
***
This repository is the official implementation of the paper [Multi-Guiding Spark Fireworks Algorithm: Solving Multimodal Functions by Multiple Guiding Sparks in Fireworks Algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223002304). The proposed method is powerful on multimodal global optimization, which is an efficient, performant, and state-of-the-art Fireworks Algorithm (FWAðŸŽ‡) variant and easy to follow. Have fun enjoying it!

## Installation ðŸ’¡
**Step1**: clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mxxxr/MGFWA.git
```

**Step2**: create a conda environment

```shell
conda create -n fwa python=3.8
conda activate fwa
```

**Step3**: install the dependencies

```shell
cd MGFWA
pip install numpy tqdm .
```

## Run ðŸš€

Perform a stantard optimization process on the given benchmark (chosen from `cec2013` and `cec2017`) by the given algorithm (chosen from `MGFWA` and `LoTFWA`):

```
python optimize.py --alg MGFWA --benchmark cec2013
```

The whole process will optimize each Function 51 times. After finishing the optimization of a single Funciton, the results will be output in the terminal:

```python
Function #1, Optimizing...
MAX: 0.0
MIN: 0.0
MEAN: 0.0
MEDIAN: 0.0
STD: 0.0
Average runtime of a run: 17.03
```

## Results ðŸ“ˆ

> Please refer to the paper for more quantitative results.
